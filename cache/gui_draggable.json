        "To implement this function, you can use JavaScript's built-in event listeners and some basic geometry to calculate the new position of the root element when the drag handle is dragged. Here's a simple implementation:\n\n```javascript\n// Assuming window.os is already defined and has a gui property\nif (!window.os) {\n    window.os = {};\n}\nif (!window.os.gui) {\n    window.os.gui = {};\n}\n\n// Define makeDraggable function\nwindow.os.gui.makeDraggable = function (root, dragHandle) {\n    let offsetX = 0;\n    let offsetY = 0;\n    let mouseX = 0;\n    let mouseY = 0;\n    \n    const handleMouseDown = function (e) {\n        e = e || window.event;\n        mouseX = e.clientX;\n        mouseY = e.clientY;\n        offsetX = root.offsetLeft - mouseX;\n        offsetY = root.offsetTop - mouseY;\n        \n        document.onmouseup = function () {\n            document.onmousemove = null;\n            document.onmouseup = null;\n        };\n        \n        document.onmousemove = function (e) {\n            e = e || window.event;\n            mouseX = e.clientX;\n            mouseY = e.clientY;\n            root.style.left = (mouseX + offsetX) + 'px';\n            root.style.top = (mouseY + offsetY) + 'px';\n        };\n    };\n    \n    dragHandle.onmousedown = handleMouseDown;\n};\n\n```",
        "Here's a simple implementation of your request using plain JavaScript. This code assumes that you have a way to get the current width and height of your root element and a way to set them. The actual implementation of these methods would depend on your specific application and how you handle state and layout changes.\n\n```javascript\n// Assuming window.os exists and has a gui property\nif (!window.os) {\n    window.os = {};\n}\nif (!window.os.gui) {\n    window.os.gui = {};\n}\n\n// Define makeResizable function\nwindow.os.gui.makeResizable = function(root, resizeHandle) {\n    let startX;\n    let startY;\n    let startWidth = root.offsetWidth;\n    let startHeight = root.offsetHeight;\n    \n    // Handle mousedown event to start resizing\n    resizeHandle.addEventListener('mousedown', function(e) {\n        e.preventDefault();\n        startX = e.clientX;\n        startY = e.clientY;\n        \n        document.addEventListener('mousemove', handleMouseMove);\n        document.addEventListener('mouseup', handleMouseUp);\n    });\n    \n    // Handle mousemove event to resize element\n    function handleMouseMove(e) {\n        let width = startWidth + e.clientX - startX;\n        let height = startHeight + e.clientY - startY;\n        \n        root.style.width = width + 'px';\n        root.style.height = height + 'px';\n    }\n    \n    // Handle mouseup event to stop resizing and update starting width and height\n    function handleMouseUp() {\n        startWidth = root.offsetWidth;\n        startHeight = root.offsetHeight;\n        \n        document.removeEventListener('mousemove', handleMouseMove);\n        document.removeEventListener('mouseup', handleMouseUp);\n    }\n};\n\n```",

    "library": "The provided JavaScript code defines four functions on the `window.os.gui` object: \n\n1. `makeDraggable(root, dragHandle)`: This function makes an element draggable by setting up event listeners for mouse events that allow for dragging of the element when the drag handle (provided as an argument to the function) is clicked and dragged over. The element's position is updated in real-time as the mouse moves, and it stops being dragged when the mouse button is released.\n\n2. `makeResizable(root, resizeHandle)`: This function makes an element resizable by setting up event listeners for mouse events that allow for resizing of the element when the resize handle (provided as an argument to the function) is clicked and dragged over. The element's width and height are updated in real-time as the mouse moves, and it stops being resized when the mouse button is released.\n\n3. `bringToFront(rootDomNode)`: This function brings a specified DOM node to the front of other nodes with the same class by setting their z-index to 0, then setting the z-index of the rootDomNode to 1. This effectively places it in front of all other nodes with the same class.\n\n4. The last part of your code checks if the `window.os` and `window.os.gui` objects exist, creating them if they don't, before assigning these four functions to them. This ensures that these objects exist before any of these functions are called, preventing potential errors if they are called before these objects are initialized. \n\nIn summary, this code provides a set of utility functions for creating draggable, resizable, and front-bringing elements in a web page, which can be useful for creating user interfaces or other interactive web applications.\n\n```"
