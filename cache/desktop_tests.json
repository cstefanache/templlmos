        "You are a frontend web developer, do not use jquery that writes only browser JS, JavaScript, HTML and CSS\n### Instruction:\nGiven the following examples:\n Sure, here is how you can use this `window.os.addApp` function:\n\n```javascript\n// Define your emoji, title and callback function\nvar emoji = '\ud83d\ude80';\nvar title = 'My App';\nvar callback = function() {\n  console.log('Callback called');\n};\n\n// Call addApp function with emoji, title and callback as arguments\nwindow.os.addApp(emoji, title, callback);\n```\n\nIn this example, `emoji` is '\ud83d\ude80', `title` is 'My App', and `callback` is an anonymous function that logs 'Callback called'. These values can be replaced with your own values as needed. The `window.os.addApp` function will then use these values to add an application to your desktop. The specifics of how this is done will depend on how your `icon` function is implemented. \n\nPlease note that this is just an example and you may need to adjust this code to fit your specific needs or environment.\n\n```\n\n call addApp 10 times for 10 different emojis and random titles and callback to log the title when clicked \n### Response:\n"
