        "You are a frontend web developer, do not use jquery that writes only browser JS, JavaScript, HTML and CSS\n### Instruction:\nGiven the following examples:\n Sure, here is how you can use these functions in your code:\n\n1. `window.os.gui.createWindow` - This is used to create a new window with customizable parameters such as emoji, title, width, and height. The default values are set to '\ud83d\udda5\ufe0f' for emoji, 'Window' for title, 400 for width, and 300 for height if no arguments are provided. The function returns the root element of the newly created window. \n\nExample Usage: \n```javascript\nvar newWindowElement = window.os.gui.createWindow('\ud83d\udcda', 'My Book Window', 600, 400);\n```\n\n2. `window.os.gui.attachToWindow` - This is used to attach an existing DOM element to an existing window DOM element. The first argument is the window element to which you want to attach the content, and the second argument is the content element you want to attach to the window. \n\nExample Usage: \n```javascript\nvar contentElement = document.createElement('p');\ncontentElement.textContent = \"This is some content\";\nwindow.os.gui.attachToWindow(newWindowElement, contentElement);\n```\nIn this example, `contentElement` is attached to `newWindowElement`, which is assumed to be an existing window created using `window.os.gui.createWindow`. \n\nPlease note that these functions make use of other helper functions like `bringToFront`, `titleBar`, `makeDraggable`, and `makeResizable`, which you would need to define as well to make these examples work. These helper functions handle the specific behaviors of creating and managing windows, such as making elements draggable, resizable, and bringing elements to front of other elements in the DOM. \n\nAlso, these examples assume you have already included these JavaScript files in your HTML file, and they have been loaded before these examples are run. If not, you would need to include them in your HTML file using `<script>` tags. \n\nRemember to replace `'\ud83d\udcda'`, `'My Book Window'`, `600`, `400`, and `\"This is some content\"` with your desired values to customize your new window and its content.\n\n```Sure, here is how you can use this `window.os.addApp` function:\n\n```javascript\n// Define your emoji, title and callback function\nvar emoji = '\ud83d\ude80';\nvar title = 'My App';\nvar callback = function() {\n  console.log('Callback called');\n};\n\n// Call addApp function with emoji, title and callback as arguments\nwindow.os.addApp(emoji, title, callback);\n```\n\nIn this example, `emoji` is '\ud83d\ude80', `title` is 'My App', and `callback` is an anonymous function that logs 'Callback called'. These values can be replaced with your own values as needed. The `window.os.addApp` function will then use these values to add an application to your desktop. The specifics of how this is done will depend on how your `icon` function is implemented. \n\nPlease note that this is just an example and you may need to adjust this code to fit your specific needs or environment.\n\n```This JavaScript function `window.os.getOSIcon` is used to create an icon for a file or directory at a given path. The icon includes an emoji indicating whether it is a file or directory, a title showing the name of the file or directory, and an optional emoji from an application registry if the file has an associated extension. \n\nThe function takes two parameters: `path` (a string representing the file or directory path), and `callback` (a function to be called when the icon is clicked). \n\nHere is an example of how to use this function:\n\n```javascript\nconst iconDiv = window.os.getOSIcon('/home/user/documents/myfile.txt', (path) => {\n  console.log('File clicked:', path);\n});\ndocument.body.appendChild(iconDiv);\n```\n\nIn this example, `/home/user/documents/myfile.txt` is passed as the `path` parameter and an anonymous function is passed as the `callback` parameter. The anonymous function logs to the console when the icon is clicked. The returned `iconDiv` is then appended to the body of the HTML document. \n\nPlease note that this code assumes that `window.os.fs.isFile` and `window.os.registry` exist and work as expected. The `isFile` method checks if the path is for a file and `registry` is an object where file extensions can be mapped to emojis and callbacks. If an extension is found in `registry`, an additional emoji and callback will be added to the icon. \n\nAlso note that this code assumes Unix-style paths (i.e., paths separated by slashes), and it uses the last part of the path as the title (i.e., the filename). If your paths use different conventions, you may need to adjust this code accordingly.\n\n```\n\n create a new function `registerApplication` on the `window.os` object that takes a title, emoji, callback, width=400 and height = 400 and a an array of extensions being undefined by default having the following functionality:\n- define an internal `execute` that takes a spread params:\n  - creates a new window instance with the title, emoji, width and height and saves it to a constant\n  - attach to window the result of calling the callback with the window instance and spread params\n- if extensions is defined, call `registerExtension` for each extension with the emoji and the execute function\n- call addApp with the emoji, title and execute function \n### Response:\n"

        "Here's an example of how to implement this new function on the `window.os` object:\n\n```javascript\n// Define new function on window.os object\nwindow.os.registerApplication = function(title, emoji, callback, width=400, height=400, extensions=undefined) {\n  // Define internal execute function\n  const execute = (...params) => {\n    // Create new window instance with title, emoji, width and height\n    const windowInstance = window.os.gui.createWindow(emoji, title, width, height);\n    // Attach to window the result of calling callback with windowInstance and spread params\n    window.os.gui.attachToWindow(windowInstance, callback(windowInstance, ...params));\n  };\n  \n  // If extensions is defined, call registerExtension for each extension with emoji and execute function\n  if (extensions) {\n    extensions.forEach(extension => {\n      window.os.registerExtension(extension, emoji, execute);\n    });\n  }\n  \n  // Call addApp with emoji, title and execute function\n  window.os.addApp(emoji, title, execute);\n};\n\n```"

    "library": "This JavaScript code defines a function `registerApplication` which is used to register an application with certain properties and behaviors in an operating system-like environment. Here's how you can use it:\n\n```javascript\n// Assume os and gui objects and registerExtension and addApp methods have been defined elsewhere in your code\n// Also assume you have an array of extensions ready to be registered with this application\nconst extensions = ['ext1', 'ext2', 'ext3']; \n\n// Define your application's title, emoji, and callback function\nconst title = 'My App';\nconst emoji = '\ud83d\ude80';\nconst callback = (winInstance, param1, param2) => {\n  console.log('Callback called with params', param1, param2);\n  return 'Some result';  // This will be attached to the window instance and returned from execute function\n};\n\n// Register your application with optional parameters for width and height (default is 400)\n// and an optional array of extensions (default is undefined)\nwindow.os.registerApplication(title, emoji, callback, 600, 600, extensions); \n```\nIn this example, `callback` is a function that will be called when your application is executed (i.e., when its icon is clicked in the operating system). It receives two parameters (`param1` and `param2`) which can be any values you choose when calling `execute` (the `execute` function is defined inside `registerApplication` and is called when your application is registered). The `callback` function should return something that will be attached to the window instance and returned from `execute`. \n\nThe `width` and `height` parameters (default is 400) specify the initial size of your application's window when it's first created. \n\nThe `extensions` parameter (default is undefined) is an array of extension names to be registered with your application. Each extension will be registered with your application's `emoji` and `execute` function. \n\nFinally, `addApp` is called with your application's `emoji`, `title` and `execute` function to add your application to the list of available applications in the operating system. \n\nThis is just an example of how you might use this `registerApplication` function in your code. The actual behavior and requirements of your operating system and its applications would depend on how these methods and objects have been defined elsewhere in your code.\n\n```",
