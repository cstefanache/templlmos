        "You are a frontend web developer, do not use jquery that writes only browser JS, JavaScript, HTML and CSS\n### Instruction:\nGiven the following examples:\n Sure, here is how you can use these functions in your code:\n\n1. `window.os.gui.createWindow` - This is used to create a new window with customizable parameters such as emoji, title, width, and height. The default values are set to '\ud83d\udda5\ufe0f' for emoji, 'Window' for title, 400 for width, and 300 for height if no arguments are provided. The function returns the root element of the newly created window. \n\nExample Usage: \n```javascript\nvar newWindowElement = window.os.gui.createWindow('\ud83d\udcda', 'My Book Window', 600, 400);\n```\n\n2. `window.os.gui.attachToWindow` - This is used to attach an existing DOM element to an existing window DOM element. The first argument is the window element to which you want to attach the content, and the second argument is the content element you want to attach to the window. \n\nExample Usage: \n```javascript\nvar contentElement = document.createElement('p');\ncontentElement.textContent = \"This is some content\";\nwindow.os.gui.attachToWindow(newWindowElement, contentElement);\n```\nIn this example, `contentElement` is attached to `newWindowElement`, which is assumed to be an existing window created using `window.os.gui.createWindow`. \n\nPlease note that these functions make use of other helper functions like `bringToFront`, `titleBar`, `makeDraggable`, and `makeResizable`, which you would need to define as well to make these examples work. These helper functions handle the specific behaviors of creating and managing windows, such as making elements draggable, resizable, and bringing elements to front of other elements in the DOM. \n\nAlso, these examples assume you have already included these JavaScript files in your HTML file, and they have been loaded before these examples are run. If not, you would need to include them in your HTML file using `<script>` tags. \n\nRemember to replace `'\ud83d\udcda'`, `'My Book Window'`, `600`, `400`, and `\"This is some content\"` with your desired values to customize your new window and its content.\n\n```Sure, here is how you can use this `window.os.addApp` function:\n\n```javascript\n// Define your emoji, title and callback function\nvar emoji = '\ud83d\ude80';\nvar title = 'My App';\nvar callback = function() {\n  console.log('Callback called');\n};\n\n// Call addApp function with emoji, title and callback as arguments\nwindow.os.addApp(emoji, title, callback);\n```\n\nIn this example, `emoji` is '\ud83d\ude80', `title` is 'My App', and `callback` is an anonymous function that logs 'Callback called'. These values can be replaced with your own values as needed. The `window.os.addApp` function will then use these values to add an application to your desktop. The specifics of how this is done will depend on how your `icon` function is implemented. \n\nPlease note that this is just an example and you may need to adjust this code to fit your specific needs or environment.\n\n```\n\n create a new function `registerApplication` on the `window.os` object that takes a title, emoji, callback, width=400 and height = 400 having the following functionality:\n- define an internal `execute` that takes a spread params:\n  - creates a new window instance with the title, emoji, width and height and saves it to a constant\n  - attach to window the result of calling the callback with the window instance and spread params\n- call addApp with the title, emoji, execute function \n### Response:\n"

        "Here's an example of how you could implement this function:\n\n```javascript\n// Define the registerApplication function on window.os\nwindow.os.registerApplication = function(title, emoji, callback, width=400, height=400) {\n  // Define an internal execute function\n  const execute = function(...params) {\n    // Create a new window instance with the title, emoji, width and height\n    const windowInstance = window.os.gui.createWindow(emoji, title, width, height);\n    \n    // Attach to window the result of calling the callback with the window instance and spread params\n    window.os.gui.attachToWindow(windowInstance, callback(windowInstance, ...params));\n  };\n  \n  // Call addApp with the title, emoji, execute function \n  window.os.addApp(emoji, title, execute);\n};\n\n```"

    "library": "This JavaScript code defines a `registerApplication` function on `window.os` object. This function takes four arguments `title`, `emoji`, `callback` and an optional `width` and `height` arguments with default values of 400. \n\nHere's how you can use this `registerApplication` function:\n\n```javascript\n// Assuming you have defined `addApp` and `gui` objects and `createWindow` and `attachToWindow` methods in your code\n// Also assuming `callback` is a function that takes `windowInstance` and some parameters and returns an object to be attached to the window\n\n// Register an application with title \"My App\", emoji \"\ud83d\ude80\", callback to handle application logic and optional dimensions 600x600\nwindow.os.registerApplication(\"My App\", \"\ud83d\ude80\", (winInstance, param1, param2) => {\n  // Your application logic here using winInstance and param1 and param2\n  return { /* some object to be attached to the window */ };\n}, 600, 600);\n```\nIn this example, `callback` is a function that takes `winInstance` and `param1` and `param2` as parameters and returns an object to be attached to the window. The `winInstance` is an instance of the created window and `param1` and `param2` are additional parameters passed when calling `execute` function. \n\nThe `execute` function creates a new window instance with the provided `emoji` and `title`, and `width` and `height` (default to 400 if not provided). It then attaches to this window instance the result of calling `callback` with `winInstance` and `param1` and `param2` as parameters. \n\nFinally, `registerApplication` calls `addApp` with `emoji`, `title` and `execute` function to add this application to the list of registered applications in `os` object. \n\nThis way, you can easily document this `registerApplication` function and its usage in your codebase.\n\n```",
